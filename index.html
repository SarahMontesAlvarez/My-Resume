					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<p>
                        OWith over 15 years of experience in human resources and talent acquisition, I currently serve as Human Resources Director at Hess Services, where I lead HR strategy across the full employee lifecycle, including talent acquisition, employee relations, compliance, performance management, and organizational development. I partner closely with leadership as a trusted advisor, aligning people strategies with business goals while building practical, people-first processes that support both employees and operations. A lifelong learner at heart, I’m always curious and growth-minded, an avid (and fast) reader, and a firm believer that books and travel are two of the best ways to broaden perspective. </p>
